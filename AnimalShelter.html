      <h3>Meet Sola</h3>
      <img src="img/owl.jpg" alt="an image of an owl">
      <p>We have a magestic owl that would not leave our side once we found her hanging upside down with her foot caught inbetween some branches. She is very fragile due to being lost in the middle of the woods. We think she would make a great candidate with senior citizens.</p>

      <h3>Meet Emma and David</h3>
      <img src="img/pig.jpg" alt="image of guinea pigs">
      <p>We have cute little guinea pigs who came from the same liter. We would like to keep them together since they are brother and sister. They are adorable and well behaved. They get along with children. Adopt them now and see them go running in their ball.</p>

      <h3>Meet Slater</h3>
      <img src="img/snake.jpg" alt="an image of a snake">
      <p>Slater the snake is one of a kind. We suggest you know about snakes before investing into taking him. We believe he may or may not be poisonous. So if you're feeling frisky and want to take a chance with life. By all means...he's all yours.</p>
